1. What is a clique?
  
   A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices 
in the clique are adjacent, which means that in a clique, all vertices have different colours.

2. How knowing that there is a clique of size m could help with 
   the task of finding the smallest k such that a graph is k-colourable?

   If there is a clique of size m, which means that within the clique, every two distinct vertices have to have 
different colours, so all vertices in the clique have to have different colours, which means that,
we will need at least m colour, in other words, k >= m.

3. What is the maximum clique problem?
   
   A maximum clique of a graph, G, is a clique, such that there is no clique with more vertices. 
Moreover, the clique number w(G) of a graph G is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in G.
   The maximum clique problem is to find a maximum clique in a given graph.

4. What is its complexity? 

   It is NP-complete. Algorithms for this problem usually run in exponential time (O(2^n)). 

5. How is this problem related to the problem of graph colourability?
   
   The maximum clique problem is the lower bound of the graph colourability problem.
   In Q2, we know that if there is a clique of size m, then the graph is k-colourable,
and k >= m. So assume we have size m1, m2, m3,..., mn cliques, and m = max(m1, m2, ..., mn),
then we have k >= m1, k >= m2, ..., k >= mn, and since m is the largest, finally, we have 
k >= m, where m is the size of the maximum clique.
