Explanation of why the 0/1 Knapsack Problem has the three necessary properties.

1. Simple Subproblems
The knapsack problem can be divided into subproblems(i.e. fill the partial solution table) that 
for each given weight(0-W), and each item(1-Nitem), what is the maximum value of 
those items whose total weight should be smaller than the given weight.

2. Subproblem Optimality
The final solution is the compostion of the optimal subproblems' solution, because,
for each subproblem, we have considered all the possibilities(i.e take the item or discard), 
and we choose the option that have the maximum(optimal) value.

3. Subproblem Overlap
Optimal solutions to unrelated subproblems can contain subproblems in common.
In our case, the partial solution table is the "memorization", when we consider whether 
take the item or discard, we reference the previous filling part of the table, because 
those are already be the optimal outcomes, all we need to do is add the current item's 
weight and value if we want to pick the item.
