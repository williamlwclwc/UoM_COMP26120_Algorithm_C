1. Why a greedy approach is not necessarily optimal for 0/1 knapsack problem?
Because in a greedy approach, we just take the item that has the most value/weight
ratio until it reaches the limit of the capacity, however, taking the item with most 
value/weight ratio is not necessarily always the optimal choice of the current situation, 
which violates the "Subproblem Optimality" property, for example:
if we have 10 capacity, and we have 3 items: 
(1) value: 7, weight 7; (2) value: 5, weight 6; (3) value: 3, weight 4,
in the greedy approach, we will choose item (1) because it has the highest ratio,
and then we find out that we only have 3 capacity left, so we stop with final value 7,
but actually, we can choose both (2) and (3) with the final value 8, which is better.

2. Is it optimal for the fractional case?
Yes, because in the fractional case, the item we select with the most ratio is always 
the optimal choice, because we can always fill up our knapsack if we are allowed to divide items, 
which means that the global optimal solution to the problem is reached by each step of our greedy 
method(local optimal), which means that the fractional case has the greedy choice property.
